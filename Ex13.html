    <h2>Beautiful Sunset</h2><br>
    <img src="sunset.jpg" alt="Mountains">
    <p>It's a proven mood booster. I can just watch the sunset in awe as it unfolds. It's all those beautiful colours like orange, red, yellow and sometimes shades of blue and purple all mixed that look like a gorgeous canvas in the sky. The sky is a beautiful canvas, and each day it paints a new portrait.</p><hr>

    <h2>Majestic mountains</h2><br>
    <img src="Mountains.jpg" alt="mountains" width="250">
    <p>Majestic Mountain is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades, and is situated on land administered by the Okanoganâ€“Wenatchee National Forest.[2] The mountain is a long ridge paralleling Mill Creek, and has several subpeaks, the highest of which is the North Peak (7,510 ft).[2] The nearest higher peak is Mount Ballard, 1.9 miles (3.1 km) to the east.[2] Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) above Mill Creek in approximately three-quarters mile</p>
